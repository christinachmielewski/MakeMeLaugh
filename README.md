My PearlHacks 2021 Submission using Figma - interactive application to ease the boredom of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

We started with a different platform and spent hours trying to get the right extensions to make it work the same across all of our devices. After struggling for much of the day we changed the concept to a website but were disappointed because we felt an app would work best. Then we stumbled upon Figma and it seemed like the perfect fix. We began teaching ourselves and each other to make up for lost time. We altered our concept to be even better as we worked, and through the journey found things like UI tool kits and Figma's auto-layout function that became huge timesavers.

Below is the link to my demo as well as my Devpost that credits my other two group members on their contributions.
